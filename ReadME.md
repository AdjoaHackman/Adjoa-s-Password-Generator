## Challenge #3
The purpose of this challenge is to write Javascript code that would generate a random passcode with specific criteria. 

## Description
For this assignment, I honestly had no idea where to start so I started watching JavaScript tutorials and met with my TA and instructor. My instructor suggested that I write out the steps I think I should take to complete the assignment, so I did. Here is what I wrote: 1. Create a few variables with the special characters, letters and numbers needed to create a password. 2. Add password requirements i.e. length 3. Create a function that will generate a password. It is not very detailed and I had no idea how to actually code i.e. create a function and then generate a response, etc. 

So I went to tutoring and the tutor made me pseudocode everything out - line by line, which you can see in the code starting at line 91. This helped tremendously because it made me think about how JavaScript actually works. The next step was figuring out the syntax. I am still having trouble knowing which attributes to use. So, I reached out to engineers I used to work with and asked for help after classes ended last week. I was on the phone with them for hours and had so many questions i.e. why do we have to use Math floor, ParseInt, etc. All of the comments in my code are basically notes I wrote from all of the questions I had or me writing out what the code means after I typed it out. Once I figured out what I wanted - to write a simple function that said if the criteria was true, then to generate the password - my friend said then we can use concat. That seemed like the most simple method? I know there are other ways but at this time, I am just happy that the code I wrote works! 

I honestly can't wait until I can write code like my instructor - he does it seamlessly.

## What Did I Learn?
Holy shit this is hard. As a TPM, - I want to apologize to the engineers I work with for pushing them so hard to make deadlines. Coding is so time consuming. It is amazing how we can just surf the internet and not even realize how much work goes into the different websites. 

## Credits
I would like to thank my TA, Michael for being so patient and kind and for jumping on a call with me whenever I need his help. He is the best! I also appreciate my instructor for staying a few minutes past office hours to help me debug my code. He made me feel seen this week and I am so grateful. I appreciate my tutor for introducing me to pseudocoding because it helps me map out my thoughts and understand what I am trying to solve. 

I am so lucky to work at a tech company with a bunch of engineers who are fluent in JavaScript. I would like to give a special thanks to my former colleagues, Jefferson and Brian, who each spent at least 3 hours on the phone with me explaining each line of code until I understood everything. It is so good to have friends who want to help you succeed and I am grateful because I was extremely nervous about this assignment. 

Please note that I did not make multiple commits with this particular assignment because my repository was not set up correctly and I had to attend office hours to fix it with my instructor. I tried to fix it with my TA but we were unable to fix the issue.
