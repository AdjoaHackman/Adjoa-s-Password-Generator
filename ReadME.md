## Description
For this assignment,

## What Did I Learn?
Holy shit this is hard. As a TPM, - I want to apologize to the engineers I work with for pushing them so hard to make deadlines. Coding is so time consuming. It is amazing how we can just surf the internet and not even realize how much work goes into the different websites. 

## Credits
I would like to thank my TA, Michael for being so patient and kind and for jumping on a call with me whenever I need his help. He is the best! I also appreciate my instructor for staying a few minutes past office hours to help me debug my code. He made me feel seen this week and I am so grateful. 

I am so lucky to work at a tech company with a bunch of engineers who are fluent in JavaScript. I would like to give a special thanks to my former colleagues, Jefferson and Brian, who each spent at least 3 hours on the phone with me explaining each line of code until I understood everything. It is so good to have friends who want to help you succeed and I am grateful because I was extremely nervous about this assignment.
